## Getting Started (Installation)

You can either run GPT Impostor directly on a computer using Python or run it in a pre-built environment via docker.

### Bare-metal

1. Clone this repo and cd into the directory: `git clone https://github.com/HHousen/GPT-Impostor && cd gpt-impostor`
2. Install Python and Pip. On most linux systems this can be done with `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`.
3. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv env`
4. Activate virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
6. Make a copy of `.env.example` (`cp .env.example .env`) and change the `BOT_TOKEN` value to your bot's token.
7. Source your environment variables: `source .env`
8. Run the bot: `python3 bot.py`

### Docker

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Get the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HHousen/GPT-Impostor/master/docker-compose.yml`
3. Replace the `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable in docker-compose.yml with your bot's token.
4. (Optional) Change the volume mapping. The database and log files are located at `/usr/src/app/db_log` within the container. To make sure these files are not erased when the container updates, they are mapped to `/opt/gpt-impostor` on the host system. You can change the location of these files on the host system if desired by modifying the part that reads `/opt/gpt-impostor`.
5. Start the container: `sudo docker-compose up -d gpt-impostor`.
